## Reflection
This is a simple login application where the customer enters their phone number in the first input field and submits it, the customer receives the access code via text and enters it into the second input field.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0 JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize the initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
